# some reminders so you can stay in growth mindest: 

   1. when you fell you out of gumption you walk out leave it and back when you'r more inspired 
    
   2. when ever i feel lazy about do something i try to remember that it just the begining of it and when i did it i will feel much better

   3.  its good to do a review in the weekend and ask my self tow question :
        - what was the best part of the days ?
        - What went wrong, and how can I make sure it doesnâ€™t happen again?
      the tow question help me to see what the thing that im good at
      and what the thing i should put more effort on .
