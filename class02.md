## text
 
 -  HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).

 -  They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

 ## INTRODUCING CSS:

  -  CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.

  -  Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).
  
  -  Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.

  -  Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties.

  -  CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.

- Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.

- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), 
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). 

- Expressions evaluate into a single value. 

- Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value. 

## Decisions and Loops :

- Conditional statements allow your code to make 
decisions about what to do next. 

- Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands. 

- Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators. 

- if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
