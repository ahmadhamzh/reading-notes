# Operators and Loops

*JavaScript has both binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator. A binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator:*

###  **JavaScript has the following types of operators :**

- ### **Assignment operators**

  An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand.

- ### **Comparison operators**

   A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values.

- ### **Arithmetic operators**

  An arithmetic operator takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value.

- ### **Bitwise operators**

  A bitwise operator treats their operands as a set of 32 bits (zeros and ones), rather than as decimal, hexadecimal, or octal numbers. 

- ### **Logical operators**

   Logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values; when they are, they return a Boolean value. However, the && and || operators actually return the value of one of the specified operands, so if these operators are used with non-Boolean values, they may return a non-Boolean value.

- ### **String operators**

  In addition to the comparison operators, which can be used on string values, the concatenation operator (+) concatenates two string values together, returning another string that is the union of the two operand strings.

- ### **Conditional (ternary) operator**

 The conditional operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands. The operator can have one of two values based on a condition.

- ### **Comma operator**

   The comma operator (,) evaluates both of its operands and returns the value of the last operand.

- ### **Unary operators**

  A unary operation is an operation with only one operand.

- ### **Relational operators**

  A relational operator compares its operands and returns a Boolean value based on whether the comparison is true.

# Loops (for , while Statement)

- ### **FOR Statement

 A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.
A for statement looks as follows:

>for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement

- ### **do...while statement**

  The do...while statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.

A do...while statement looks as follows:

>do

>  statement

>  while (condition);

- ### **while statement**

A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.

 A while statement looks as follows:

 >while (condition)

 > statement
