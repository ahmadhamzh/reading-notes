# Review, Research, and Discussion

### What are serverless functions?

 serverless function is a programmatic function written by a software developer for a single purpose. It's then hosted and maintained on infrastructure by cloud computing companies.

 ### If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?

 The AWS Lambda Runtime Interface Emulator (RIE) is a proxy for the Lambda Runtime API that allows you to locally test your Lambda function packaged as a container image. The emulator is a lightweight web server that converts HTTP requests into JSON events to pass to the Lambda function in the container image.

 ### Describe how a CDN works

 CDN is a network of servers that distributes content from an “origin” server throughout the world by caching content close to where each end user is accessing the internet via a web-enabled device. The content they request is first stored on the origin server and is then replicated and stored elsewhere as needed.

**SeServerless Functions** | a cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider allocates machine resources on demand, taking care of the servers on behalf of their customers.
**Cloud Storage** | a cloud computing model that stores data on the Internet through a cloud computing provider.
**CDN** | geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. The goal is to provide high availability and performance by distributing the service spatially relative to end users.

### What is Amazon API Gateway?

Amazon API Gateway is a managed service that allows developers to define the HTTP endpoints of a REST API or a WebSocket API and connect those endpoints with the corresponding backend business logic. It also handles authentication, access control, monitoring, and tracing of API requests.

### What is DynamoDB?

DynamoDB is a hosted NoSQL database offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It offers:

* reliable performance even as it scales;

* a managed experience, so you won't be SSH-ing into servers to upgrade the crypto libraries;

* a small, simple API allowing for simple key-value access as well as more advanced query patterns.
