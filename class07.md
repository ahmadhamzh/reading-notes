## Domain modeling :

- Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem.
- some tips to follow when building your own domain models :
  - When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
  - Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
  - Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
  - Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
  - Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
  - Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.


## Tables :
-     <table>

 this element is used to add tables to a web 
page.

-      <tr>
 A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created with this element.

 -     <td> for data in row, <th> for header data row

 -  You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.

 -       For long tables you can split the table into a <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot>.

## Functions, Methods, and Objects :

- Functions allow you to group a set of related 
statements together that represent a single task.
- Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value.
- An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you. 
- n an object, variables are known as properties of the 
object; functions are known as methods of the object.
- Web browsers implement objects that represent both 
the browser window and the document loaded into the 
browser window.
- JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts. 
- Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).
