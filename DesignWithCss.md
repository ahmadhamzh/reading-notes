# What is CSS?

 - ### **What is CSS?**

  CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages,

- ### **What is CSS for?**

 CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create layout — for example turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation.

>Note: A browser is sometimes called a user agent, which basically means a computer program that represents a person inside a computer system. Browsers are the main type of user agent we think of when talking about CSS, however, it is not the only one. There are other user agents available — such as those which convert HTML and CSS documents into PDFs to be printed.

 - ### **CSS syntax**

  CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.

  >h1 {

   > color: red;

    >font-size: 5em;
>}

- ### **CSS Modules**

 As there are so many things that you could style using CSS, the language is broken down into modules. You'll see reference to these modules as you explore MDN and many of the documentation pages are organized around a particular module.

 - ### **CSS Specifications**

 All web standards technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) are defined in giant documents called specifications (or "specs"), which are published by standards organizations (such as the W3C, WHATWG, ECMA, or Khronos) and define precisely how those technologies are supposed to behave.

 - ### **Browser support information**

  Once CSS has been specified then it is only useful for us in developing web pages if one or more browsers have implemented it. This means that the code has been written to turn the instruction in our CSS file into something that can be output to the screen.
