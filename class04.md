#  *Duckett HTML BOOK:*

## links :
 
 -     <a> 
  Links are created using this lement.

  
  -  This element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.

  -  If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.

  -  You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.

  -  You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.

  ## Layout :

  -     <div> 
  elements are often used as containing elements 
to group together sections of a page.
-  Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
-  The float property moves content to the left or right 
of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
-  Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
-  Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, 
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels.
-  Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
-  You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

## Functions, Methods, and Objects :

- Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a 
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task,
-     function updateMessage() { 
        var el = document.getElementByld('message'}; 
          el .textContent = msg; 
        } 
      updateMessage(};

- Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required 
to do their job) and may return a value.
