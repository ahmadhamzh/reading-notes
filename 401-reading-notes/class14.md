# Review, Research, and Discussion

### Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?

Standard queues provide at-least-once delivery, which means that each message is delivered at least once. FIFO queues provide exactly-once processing, which means that each message is delivered once and remains available until a consumer processes it and deletes it.

### How can the server be assured a message was properly received?

when the client get a message from the server the client wil send a message to the server that it receved the message.

### What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?

observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

### How do you test an event driven system?

Service tests for event-driven systems operate on events for inputs and events for outputs and are unaware of other services. End-to-end Tests.
