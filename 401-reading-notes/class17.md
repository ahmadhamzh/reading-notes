# Review, Research, and Discussion

### Describe “The Cloud”

software and services that run on the Internet, instead of locally on your computer.

### What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?

container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

### What is auto-scaling?

is a method used in cloud computing that dynamically adjusts the amount of computational resources in a server farm - typically measured by the number of active servers - automatically based on the load on the farm.


### What is bandwidth?

The maximum amount of data transmitted over an internet connection in a given amount of time.

### How do cloud providers compute service costs?


When setting price, cloud providers determine the expense to maintaining the network. They start by calculating costs for network hardware, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor. These expenses are added together and then divided by the number of rack units a business will need for its IaaS cloud.

### AWS s3

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service offering industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Customers of all sizes and industries can store and protect any amount of data for virtually any use case.

### What is AWS Lambda?

AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Users of AWS Lambda create functions, self-contained applications written in one of the supported languages and runtimes, and upload them to AWS Lambda, which executes those functions in an efficient and flexible manner.

### How does AWS Lambda work?

Each Lambda function runs in its own container. When a function is created, Lambda packages it into a new container and then executes that container on a multi-tenant cluster of machines managed by AWS. Before the functions start running,
