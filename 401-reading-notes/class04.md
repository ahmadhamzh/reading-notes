# Review, Research, and Discussion

* **Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development.**

   * Better program design and higher code quality
   * Detailed project documentation
   * TDD reduces the time required for project development

* **In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?**

 you can use beforeEach and afterEach


* **What is one downside of Test Driven Development**

If you begin TDD, you’ll get the sensation that you simply need an extended duration of your time for straightforward implementations.

* **What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?**

The most important difference between class- and prototype-based inheritance is that a class defines a type which can be instantiated at runtime, whereas a prototype is itself an object instance.


* **Why REST ?**

 REST aims to make caching easier. Since the server is stateless and each request can be processed individually


 **functional programming** |  a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.
-|-
**object-oriented programming (OOP)** |  is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.
**class** |  Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 class-like semantics.
**super** |  The super keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's parent.
**this** |  In the global execution context (outside of any function), this refers to the global object whether in strict mode or not.
**Test Driven Development (TDD)** |  is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases.
**Jest** |  Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
**Continuous Integration (CI)** |   is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project. It’s a primary DevOps best practice, allowing developers to frequently merge code changes into a central repository where builds and tests then run. 
**REST** |  REST is an acronym for REpresentational State Transfer and an architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems.
**Data Model** |  is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.
