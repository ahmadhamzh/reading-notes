 ## How the Web Works

  *When you visit a website, the web server 
hosting that site could be anywhere in the 
world.* 

*its the Domain Name System (DNS) servers that tell your browser how to find the website.*

## HTML Uses Elementsto Describe the Structure of Pages
    <html>
    <body>
     <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
      <p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of 
      the page. And if the page is a long one it might 
      be split up into several sub-headings.<p>
     <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
      <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help 
      you follow the structure of what is being written. 
      There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level 
      headings).</p>
     <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
      <p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>
    </body>
    </html>
 
- *Tags act like containers. They tell you 
something about the information that lies 
between their opening and closing tags*

## Attributes Tell Us More About Elements.

  - Attributes provide additional information 
about the contents of an element. They appear 
on the opening tag of the element and are 
made up of two parts: a name and a value, 
separated by an equals sign.

## Body, Head & Title

  -     <head> </head>

  This contains information about the page (rather than information that is shown within 
the main part of the browser 
window that is highlighted in 
blue on the opposite page). 

   -     <title> </title>

   The contents of the this
element are either shown in the 
top of the browser, above where 
you usually type in the URL of 
the page you want to visit, or 
on the tab for that page
  

  -      <body> </body>
  everything inside this element is 
shown inside the main browser 
window

- ### EXTRA MARKUP :

  -  DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
  -  You can add comments to your code between the markers.

         <!-- and --> 

  -  The id and class attributes allow you to identify 
particular elements.   

  -     <div> <spam>
  these elements allow you to group 
block-level and inline elements together

  -     <iframes>

  this tag cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.

  -      <meta>

   allows you to supply all kinds of 
information about your web page
----

### HTML5 LAYOUT :

-  The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of 
different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
 -  Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 
elements need to be told which elements are 
block-level elements.

-  To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, 
which is available free from Google.
----------
### PROCESS & Design :

 - It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.

 -  Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.

 -  Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.

 -  Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.

 -  You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.

 -  You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.

 # *THE ABC OF PROGRAMMING*

   ### WHat is a script :

   - A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal. 

   - Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions. 

   - Computers approach tasks in a different way than 
humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically. 

- To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help). 

### how computers fit in with the world around them:

- computers creat models of the world using data.

- the models use objects to represent physical things,
Objects can have properties that tell us about the object.
methods that perform tasks using the properties of that object even whuch are triggered when a user interacts with the computer.

- programmers can write code to say "when this event occurs,run that code"

- web browsers use htlm markup to creat a model of the web pages.each element creates its own node (wich is kind of object).

- to make web pages interactive you write code hat uses the browser's model of the web page.

### how do i write a script for web page

- It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension. 

- The HTML element

          <script>

 is used in HTML pages 
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file .

- If you view the source code of the page in the browser, 
the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, 
because the script works with the model of the web 
page that the browser has created.
