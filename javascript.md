- ## **what is Java Scriot**
 ### *JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages .*

 - ## **what java can do**
 ### ** *Java can do things lik :* **
 - ### *Store useful values inside variables.*
 - ### *Operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming).*
 - ### *Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page.*
 - ### *A very common use of JavaScript is to dynamically modify HTML and CSS to update a user interface*

- ## **some imformation about java script**
 - ## *JavaScript is a lightweight interpreted programming language. The web browser receives the JavaScript code in its original text form and runs the script from that.* 

 - ## *Client-side code is code that is run on the user's computer — when a web page is viewed, the page's client-side code is downloaded, then run and displayed by the browser.*

 - ## *Server-side code on the other hand is run on the server, then its results are downloaded and displayed in the browser.*

 - ## *A web page with no dynamically updating content is referred to as static — it just shows the same content all the time.*

 - ## *JavaScript is applied to your HTML page in a similar manner to CSS. Whereas CSS uses <link> elements to apply external stylesheets and <style> elements to apply internal stylesheets to HTML, JavaScript only needs one friend in the world of HTML — the <script> element.*

 - ## *if we wanted to put our JavaScript file in html while the javav script file is seprate from html file we write the following command in html file*
  > <script src="script.js" defer></script>

- ## **What is a variable?**

- ### *A variable is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, or a string that we might use as part of a sentence. But one special thing about variables is that their contained values can change.*

- ### *Another special thing about variables is that they can contain just about anything — not just strings and numbers. Variables can also contain complex data and even entire functions to do amazing things*

> Note: In JavaScript, all code instructions should end with a semi-colon (;) — your code may work correctly for single lines, but probably won't when you are writing multiple lines of code together. Try to get into the habit of including it.

- ### *The reasons are somewhat historical. Back when JavaScript was first created, there was only var. This works basically fine in most cases, but it has some issues in the way it works — its design can sometimes be confusing or downright annoying. So, let was created in modern versions of JavaScript, a new keyword for creating variables that works somewhat differently to var, fixing its issues in the process.*
- ### the camel case : *is the practice of writing phrases without spaces or punctuation, indicating the separation of words with a single capitalized letter, and the first word starting with either case*
