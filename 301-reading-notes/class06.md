# NODE.JS

### What Is Node.js?

 * Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

 * Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

 * This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.

### Node Is Built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine

 * The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

***You can check that Node is installed on your system by opening a terminal and typing node -v. If all has gone well, you should see the version of Node you have, mine is v14.17.0.***

### Node.js Has Excellent Support for Modern JavaScript

 *Node has excellent support for ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and beyond. As you’re only targeting one runtime (a specific version of the V8 engine), this means that you can write your JavaScript using the latest and most modern syntax. It also means that you don’t generally have to worry about compatibility issues — as you would if you were writing JavaScript that would run in different browsers.

### Introducing npm, the JavaScript Package Manager

 * As I mentioned earlier, Node comes bundled with a package manager called npm. To check which version you have installed on your system, type 'npm -v', mine is 7.21.1.

 * In addition to being the package manager for JavaScript, npm is also the world’s largest software registry.

 to install the jshint packege

       npm install -g jshint
  
### What Is Node.js Used For?
 * installing (via npm) and running (via Node) various build tools — designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.

 * These build tools come in all shapes and sizes, and you won’t get far in a modern JavaScript landscape without bumping into them. They can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.
