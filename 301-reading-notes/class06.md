# NODE.JS

### What Is Node.js?

 * Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

 * Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

 * This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.

### Node Is Built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine

 * The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

***You can check that Node is installed on your system by opening a terminal and typing node -v. If all has gone well, you should see the version of Node you have, mine is v14.17.0.***

### Node.js Has Excellent Support for Modern JavaScript

 *Node has excellent support for ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and beyond. As you’re only targeting one runtime (a specific version of the V8 engine), this means that you can write your JavaScript using the latest and most modern syntax. It also means that you don’t generally have to worry about compatibility issues — as you would if you were writing JavaScript that would run in different browsers.

### Introducing npm, the JavaScript Package Manager

 * As I mentioned earlier, Node comes bundled with a package manager called npm. To check which version you have installed on your system, type 'npm -v', mine is 7.21.1.

 * In addition to being the package manager for JavaScript, npm is also the world’s largest software registry. 

 * to install a pagege globaly you wright this code
 to install the jshint packege

       npm install -g jshint
  
### What Is Node.js Used For?
 * installing (via npm) and running (via Node) various build tools — designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.

 * These build tools come in all shapes and sizes, and you won’t get far in a modern JavaScript landscape without bumping into them. They can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.

# Pair Programming
 
  ### How does pair programming work?

  * While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.

### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

  1 - Greater efficiency :  
  Research indicates that pair programing takes slightly longer, but produces higher-quality code that doesn’t require later effort in troubleshooting and debugging (let alone exposing users to a broken product). So, in the long-run, it’s often actually more efficient than two people working on separate features.

  2 - Engaged collaboration  
  When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone.

  3 - Learning from fellow students  
  Everyone has a different approach to problem solving; working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of. If one developer has a unique approach to a specific problem, pair programming exposes the other developer to a new solution.

  4 - Social skills  
  Pair programming is great for improving social skills. When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key. This can become more difficult when two programmers have different personalities. Pair programming not only improves programming skills, but can also help programmers develop their interpersonal skills. When just grabbing the keyboard and taking over isn’t an option, getting good at finding the right words is a skill unto itself.

  5 - Job interview readiness  
  A common step in many interview processes involves pair programming between a current employee and an applicant, either in person or through a shared screen. They will carry out exercises together, such as code challenges, building a project or feature, or debugging an existing code base. By doing so, companies can get a better feel for how an applicant will fit into the team and their collaboration style.

  6 - Work environment readiness  
  Many companies that utilize pair programing expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product. Code Fellows graduates who are already familiar with how pairing works can hit the ground running at a new job, with one less hurdle to overcome.

***from my experience i found that Engaged collaboration and Learning from fellow students and Greater efficiency is the most benefits reason for pair programing***
